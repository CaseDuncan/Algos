Question: 
       Given a `n`, find the first `n` elements of the fibonnaci sequence 

The Fibonacci sequence is a set of integers, in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence commonly starts from 0 and 1.

pseudocode:
   (i) create a function that takes one parameter=>(n)
   (ii)declare an array to hold the indexes of the first two values.
   (iii)loop through the items returning the fibonacci numbers.

   exampple input: 7
            output=>[0,1,2,3,4,5,8]
            
            input:5
            output=>[0,1,1,2,3]
